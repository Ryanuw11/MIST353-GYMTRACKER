# MIST353-GYMTRACKER
This is the Repo for the GymTracker Project. Future progress and recent commits will be documented here.

Current Progress:
  Push 1: Added the README file and made the repo accessible to everyone in the group 
  Push 2: Had some errors with MVS that required a project remake but, it wasn't that determinantal because hadn't pushed much yet
  Push 3: Added in our pages
  Push 5: Linked pages to Nav Bar and buttons

Future Advancements:
The app will use a user system that will require different users to be stored within a database
There will need to be a part of the database that stores the user's inputs into the app

I created the project and Github repos and updated README with the current progress of the project. I coded the front page for this assignment and added in a button for navigation to about us.

We would have to find a more unique name for our site. They have a clean and simple site that doesn't use a navbar but has everything on one page. They also show images of the UI of the app that they have. Alongside this, they also have a sign-in feature. Bootstrap is used for this site and they're using Bootstrap 4.0. Overall, the site is very simple and it doesn't need to be more than that it's by no means a very professional site that uses fancy Javascript, it just gets the job done.

Many people have had this idea before and some seem to coded it in Swift but the one I chose coded in C# like us. This coder used Xammarin which is used for IOS and Andriod integration so it can be used as a mobile app. It's stated that he focused only on the Andriod side of integration likely because this was a personal project and the coder likely owned an android. Overall, there are some useful functionality type codes here that could be used to base ideas on but for an actual site, the website above would be more helpful. 

CHATGPT integration

I used ChatGPT for this assignment mostly for some troubleshooting purposes because it's easier than searching through mountains of Stack questions. For example, I could not for the life of me get text to overlay on an image and people on Stack were zero help or just didn't work for me and ChatGPT got it first try (It's pretty good at CSS).
I used StackOverflow, and W3schools as well.

Not exactly the same thing, but the site uses HTML and Javascript. The iPhones shown on screen are just from a linked image source but it's a different video element inside it. The page also has input in javescript for the end user to fill out to send a request for sign up.
Similar GitHub:  https://github.com/itsindrajput/stargymhub
This project is very similar to ours. It functions like a hub for all information about fitness. It utilizes all the concepts covered from the first few weeks of class pertaining to CSS, javascript, and HTML. Some useful code snippets would be their button tag from their product page. It has a funtion to open a registration form. Also, how they comment for the code neatly describes what part of the page's code you are looking at.

Competitive Analysis:

Our selected web app idea is a workout app, so I researched an app and website called GymStreak. The website looks well-designed but offers only the most basic but necessary options and selections including a blog section, contact us page, help center, terms of use, and privacy policy. There are also links to download the app on the page. The site’s coding uses html 5. It begins with comments that say where it was created and when it was last published. It continues with the design of the website.  

GitHub Repository Research:

Similar GitHub README: It starts with a demo video of the app. The it explains how to use the app in detail. It follows by sharing what the application was built within each aspect such as front-end and back-end. The author explains what they learned. They end by mentioning future development plans, other useful resources, and closes by putting the author’s name and LinkedIn information. 			 

AI Thoughts:  
I used ChatGPT for some trouble shooting when it came to getting my html code compatible with the proper css code. I needed to make classes in html and then site it in css. I need definitely some more practice with css and combining it with html. This is the prompt I used. I also used w3schools. 
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
    <title>Contact Us</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Please provide your email address.</p>
    <form>
        <label for="email">Email Address:</label><br>

        <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br />

    </form>

</body>
What's wrong with this code for a website.

Contributions: Did the About Us page in the website and worked on the layout for the website to make sure the nav bar worked correctly. 


Competitive Analysis: 

The Website I picked to compare to was https://www.crunch.com/about 

The first thing I noticed that stood out was the pictures on the website of people working out. The website’s UI was very appealing to the user’s eye. In the about page, they also had a YouTube video attached to the website. When I looked in the inspect over half the code was just to track cookies and keep information. They would use <iframe id=> to track information. When I looked at the about It offered information about locations, membership cost, and what the gym provides. They organize the sections well with a space just for what each membership provides.


The GitHub I picked is https://github.com/WaleedAshraf/bsef12m538MusicBOX/blob/e4e0745f415d1f2a502f169d2e48f5caba2e4be2/Views/User/aboutUs.cshtml#L4 

I looked at his github and I was planning on using the thumbnail for the image in the about us section. I realized that I can use it for the table as well but I did not like what it looked like. I was interested in this because I realized it is a way to look at images with a better view of them. 



Didn't use Chatgpt only W3 schools.
