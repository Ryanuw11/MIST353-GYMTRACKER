# MIST353-GYMTRACKER
This is the Repo for the GymTracker Project. Future progress and recent commits will be documented here.

Current Progress:
  Push 1: Added the README file and made the repo accessible to everyone in the group 
  Push 2: Had some errors with MVS that required a project remake but, it wasn't that determinantal because hadn't pushed much yet
  Push 3: Added in our pages
  Push 5: Linked pages to Nav Bar and buttons

Future Advancements:
The app will use a user system that will require different users to be stored within a database
There will need to be a part of the database that stores the user's inputs into the app

I created the project and Github repos and updated README with the current progress of the project. I coded the front page for this assignment and added in a button for navigation to about us.

We would have to find a more unique name for our site. They have a clean and simple site that doesn't use a navbar but has everything on one page. They also show images of the UI of the app that they have. Alongside this, they also have a sign-in feature. Bootstrap is used for this site and they're using Bootstrap 4.0. Overall, the site is very simple and it doesn't need to be more than that it's by no means a very professional site that uses fancy Javascript, it just gets the job done.

Many people have had this idea before and some seem to coded it in Swift but the one I chose coded in C# like us. This coder used Xammarin which is used for IOS and Andriod integration so it can be used as a mobile app. It's stated that he focused only on the Andriod side of integration likely because this was a personal project and the coder likely owned an android. Overall, there are some useful functionality type codes here that could be used to base ideas on but for an actual site, the website above would be more helpful. 

CHATGPT integration

I used ChatGPT for this assignment mostly for some troubleshooting purposes because it's easier than searching through mountains of Stack questions. For example, I could not for the life of me get text to overlay on an image and people on Stack were zero help or just didn't work for me and ChatGPT got it first try (It's pretty good at CSS).
I used StackOverflow, and W3schools as well.
