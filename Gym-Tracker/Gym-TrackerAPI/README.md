API DOCUMENTATION
Ryan Dowd's work
I created two API's that serve the purpose of lookups. The first being the UserData API which serves to allow the user to view the contents of their profile when they search by their ID which will display their profile details. 
When implemeted fully it will allow the user to search for their profile and make changes to the data. The user inputs their unique ID and it will come up with their user name, email, level, etc.

The second API is meant to serve as a gym lookup feature which will allow the user to search for a gym by name and view their address and hours of operation. The user will input FITFUSION for example and it will come up with its city and its hours of operation
